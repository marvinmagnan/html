<p> My name is Marvin Magnan and i am 32 years old. In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine
that woud help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one 
steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet
against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.

<p class="two"> The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This 
enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, bot being practical for transportation in any other place
than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

<p>The next apperance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to 
the front wheel. This Machine was known as the velocipede (meaning fast foot) as well as the "bone shaker,"
since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roaas of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable
ride. The also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to the roller rinks, could be found in large
cities.
